If your IP will reliably be 192.168.1.125, I would just comment-out the
lines you show there from /etc/init.d/cloudera-quickstart-init, and I would
edit /etc/hosts to be the following:

127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.domain
192.168.159.132 quickstart.cloudera quickstart

1) Find the port which is used by supervisor: 
$ ps aux |grep supervisor
2) kill the port
$ sudo kill -9 <port number>
